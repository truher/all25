# lib.controller

This  package contains code that controls mechanisms, i.e. attempts
to drive a mechanism to a target position and/or velocity, by measuring the
actual mechanism state and applying some control law.

There are two packages here:

* `r1` for single-dimension control
* `se2` describes planar mechanisms and drivetrain motion in the SE(2) manifold.
