/**
 * Produces references based on profiles.
 * 
 * This uses the central Cache to manage reference updates, because it's
 * important that the reference updates be aligned with the clock, i.e. one
 * profile update step per Takt step, but the SwerveReference interface doesn't
 * know anything about time. Still, it's a sort of strange thing to do,
 * since it's not a "Cache" per se.
 * 
 * One of the implications of this choice is that the cache updates will
 * continue forever unless we explicitly stop them, so if you use this class,
 * you need to remember to do that.
