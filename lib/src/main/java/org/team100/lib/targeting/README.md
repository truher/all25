# lib.targeting

This package is concerned with vision targets that are
not in canonical locations, e.g. game pieces, including moving targets,
and with computing "firing solutions," i.e. where to aim the turret.

The problem of intercepting moving targets, or hitting a fixed
target from a moving platform, is discussed in depth [here](INTERCEPT.md).
