/**
 * This is a partial implementation of the URDF object model.
 * 
 * The idea is to use a more general mechanism representation than the usual
 * POJO (e.g. LynxArm, which uses fields), which would allow more general
 * kinematics than the hand-made stuff we've done previously (e.g. we could try
 * Cyclic Coordinate Descent, or Gradient Descent, in a general way)
 * 
 * It would be possible to serialize this to URDF XML and vice versa, but our
 * robots are small enough that (IMHO) putting the "loader" in code would be
 * much easier than bringing in the XML overhead.
 * 
 * See http://wiki.ros.org/urdf, in particular, urdf.xsd. I transcribed directly
 * from that file. (I tried to use JAXB to auto-generate this, but gave up
 * trying to run it.)
 * 
 * This omits the collision and visual parts of the model, which are used for
 * simulation and visualization, respectively. We could add those back in if we
 * need them someday. I haven't found the URDF visualizers (e.g.
 * https://mymodelrobot.appspot.com/5629499534213120) or simulators (e.g.
 * Gazebo) to be that useful.
 * 
 * There exists SRDF, which specifies, among other things, group states, e.g.
 * home positions. I think SRDF is dead, but representing states seems fine;
 * the format is a map of joint names and values.
