/**
 * Pose and direction in SE(2). Direction is a unit vector describing how pose
 * changes with the spline parameter.
 * 
 * For constructing splines.
 * 
 * The scale factor is somewhat like "velocity" but in the spline constructor it
 * is scaled to the total length of the spline, so it affects the shape in a
 * scale-invariant way. A common scale is 1.2, but 1.0 is often useful. I've
 * used 0.9 to make pretty good circles from four splines. Elsewhere this factor
 * is sometimes called the "magic number".
 * 
 * Our waypoints have no notion of acceleration, which means the joints in the
 * resulting trajectories are (very briefly) laterally "unloaded". I don't think
 * this makes any measurable difference in real-world movement.
 * 
 * It would be possible to have different scale factors for each side of the
 * waypoint (so one side could be straighter and the other side could be
 * curvier), but I don't think it would be worth the complexity.
 * 
 * @param pose   location and orientation
 * @param course direction of travel (in SE(2), course includes rotation)
 * @param scale  influence of the course, relative to the spline parameter [0,1]
