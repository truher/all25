# lib.indicator

This package is for things you want the drive team to know.

* LED strips, using `SolidIndicator`.  This reflects states (steady) and events (flashing briefly).
* Dashboard messages, using `Alerts`.  These are short text messages.
* Beeper, using the CTRE `MusicTone` feature.  There are a few different tone sequences available.
