# MiniLab 3 Keys

This is a version of the Minilab3 controller that uses all the keys,
black and white, not just some of them.

This uses an 
[Adafruit Feather 32u4](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2771),
an [Adafruit MIDI FeatherWing](https://learn.adafruit.com/products/4740/guides),
and the [FortySevenEffects Arduino MIDI library](https://github.com/FortySevenEffects/arduino_midi_library)
to make a MIDI controller appear like a USB HID with 32 buttons.
