# Offset Control

In 2025 we learned that 254 drivetrain control operated on the error
in the end-effector pose, rather than the robot pose, in order to avoid
controlling the drivetrain unnecessarily.  In particular, the
rotation error of the end effector was relatively unimportant.

How could we do the same thing?
