# Comp

This is the main comp bot repo.

Part of the code here was (quite distantly now) derived from 254 code, and other parts were inspired (long ago) by Roadrunner.

# SYSTEMCORE

notes for systemcore:

in http://robot.local, in the terminal, say:

```
sudo journalctl
```

to see the console output.
